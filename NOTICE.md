## Optional models

When the user opts in to download the Quebec French Whisper model
(`whisper-large-v3-turbo-fr-quebecois`), that model is governed by the license
of its original author (ele-sage on Hugging Face). MotsDits does not relicense
the model; it merely converts it from Safetensors to GGML format for
compatibility with whisper.cpp.

LLM post-processing providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, etc.)

Their respective terms of service apply; MotsDits is not a party to those
